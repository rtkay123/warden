## Project Structure

| Directory   | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/crates`   | Core distributed applications                   |
| `/lib`      | Shared utilities and libraries                  |
| `/contrib/` | Goodies which may be useful for contributors    |
| `/docs/`    | Detailed architecture and design documentation  |


## Building

### Dependencies

- [`protoc`] - protobuf compiler
- [`cargo`] - Rust's package manager
- [`rustc`] - MSRV 1.89
- [`docker`] - (optional)

> [!TIP]
> If planning to run on docker, you do not need the other 3 dependencies

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rtkay123/warden.git
cd warden
```

Warden also depends on (protobuf) types from [googleapis], which is declared
as a submodule. Update that before proceeding.

```sh
git submodule update --init --depth 1 --recommend-shallow
```

You may then proceed with building the platform through [`cargo`]:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Configure Applications

Each application requires a configuration file in TOML format. Before running,
it could be useful to checkout what each application expects through the config.

In the [crates] directory, there are subfolders representing each binary.
Each of these subfolders contains a `.toml` file used as the default config.

### External Services

Warden provides sample Docker [compose] files for the services used by the
platform at runtime:

- `compose.yaml`: contains core components which are needed for the platform to
  run
- `compose.monitoring.yaml`: contains **optional** tools for distributed for
  monitoring and distributed tracing

> [!NOTE]
> The applications may still make noise about monitoring tools not being
available in logs, but these are safe to ignore

> [!TIP]
> Silence the noise by adjusting your log level in the configuration

Each application requires a configuration file in TOML format. Before running,
it could be useful to checkout what each application expects through the config.

In the [crates](./crates/) directory, there are subfolders representing each binary.
Each of these subfolders contains a `.toml` file used as the default config.


### Run Applications

#### Native

An example for the configuration API:
```sh
cargo run -p warden-config
```

#### Docker

Build and run the images. An example for the configuration API:

```sh
docker build -f crates/configuration/Dockerfile -t warden-config:latest .
docker run -p 1304:1304 warden-config:latest 
```

> [!TIP]
> Some processors leverage conditional compilation to toggle additional features.
Checkout each processor's documentation to see what else it is capable of

### Testing End-to-End

An example for using [Bruno] for API testing is avaiable through the [sample collection and environment](./contrib/bruno/)
. This collection supplies initial configuration data and can be used for triggering the end-to-end flow

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can run the applications in any order **after** the pseudonyms and configuration
service are running
